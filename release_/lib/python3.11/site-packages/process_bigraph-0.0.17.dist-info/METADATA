# Process-Bigraph

**Process-Bigraph** is an extension of the [bigraph-schema](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/bigraph-schema) 
library, offering a computational framework that integrates process modules into bigraphs. This allows for the 
representation of complex, multiscale systems, that combine the structural capabilities of bigraphs with modular dynamic
processes. It serves as a tool for creating, simulating, and analyzing intricate and dynamic models, 
fostering a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems.

## What are Process Bigraphs?

Process Bigraphs are based on a mathematical formalism introduced by Robin Milner, which was expanded in Vivarium with 
the addition of Processes, and standardized with the introduction of the Schema format. Bigraphs provide a powerful 
framework for compositional modeling due to their ability to represent complex systems through hierarchical structures 
and flexible reconfigurations, thus enabling the seamless composition and decomposition of system components. Variables 
are contained in Stores (circles), which can be embedded in the place graph hierarchy, represented by the dark edges. 
Instead of hyperedges, CBS employs Processes (the rectangles) which have ports (solid black dots) connect via wires 
(dashed edges) to variables within the Stores. Processes are functions that read and write to variables through their 
ports. They can be used to rewrite the bigraph by adding new structure and new processes.
